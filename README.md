# AI-Agent-for-Smart-Farming-Advice
Project Overview
AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice is an intelligent assistant designed to support small-scale farmers by delivering real-time, localized agricultural guidance. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM Cloud technologies like Watsonx AI and Granite Foundation Model, this AI Agent bridges the knowledge gap by providing trusted data on weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop recommendations, pest control, and mandi price updates.

Farmers can interact in their local languages or English by asking questions such as:

“What crop is best to plant this season?”

“What is today’s mandi rate for tomatoes?”

“How to control pests in cotton?”

This project ensures timely, data-driven decisions that reduce risk, increase yield, and boost income for grassroots farming communities.
